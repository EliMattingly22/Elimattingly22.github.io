This is a magnetic particle imaging system that I helped design and construct. If you are unfamiliar with MPI I'd recommend you check out my page on the basics of MPI [here](https://elimattingly22.github.io/MPI_Basics) , because I jump right into the details here (well eventually I will, I'm still setting up the site!). This project is part of the Open-source MPI initiative so the files are all available (links below).
