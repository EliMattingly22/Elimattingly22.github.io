This magnetometer was designed to satisfy the need of an accurate method to characterize magnetic nanoparticles without prohibitively expensive equipment. This project is still being developed , but right now, it is able to quantify the magnetization response of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles up to about 150mT (this value depends on which amplifier is used). It only takes up a few square feet on the wall (wall mounted), plugs into normal 120V outlets, and depending on what instrumentation you already have costs anywhere from $500-3000. 

This project is included in the open-source magnetic particle imaging initiative (OS-MPI) and you can find all of the files below.
