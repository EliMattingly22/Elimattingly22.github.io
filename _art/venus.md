This sculpture is a marble carving I did with traditional means (hammer, chisels, etc.) in Florence, Italy in the summer of 2016 under the guidance of Jason Arkles. The carving took roughly two weeks of solid work (~6 hours a day of hammering away). You can see from the first progress picture that it was carved with a *macchinetta a punto*, an italian device that allows you to transfer points from a reference sculpture to a carving in 3D space. You can see his video on the process [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPM62HDJbms) It was a great time and if you are interested in this kind of work I would highly reccomend Jason's podcast, [The Sculptors Funeral](http://www.thesculptorsfuneral.com/).
