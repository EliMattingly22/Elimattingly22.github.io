This sculpture is one that I built for the final project in my sculpture class at MassArt. It is constructed from tangled steel links that were used in my grandfather's starter motor factory all suspended from woven steel wool strands. He passed a few months prior to this being built, so when the time came to decide on a project I wanted to incorporate something from his factory that he built.
