Below is a list of projects that I have worked on. If you click on any of the images it will send you to a page dedicated to that project with further information. These were done as part of the Magnetic Resonance Physics and Instrumentation group, and you can see more about what the group has done [here](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/lab/mr-pig).
