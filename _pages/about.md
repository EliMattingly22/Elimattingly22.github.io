Welcome to "The Open-Source MPI (OS-MPI)" project administered by the Magnetic Resonance Physics and Instrumentation Groupâ€™s Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) team. Within this website are descriptions of many of the MPI systems developed by either us or other contributing groups. The motivation for building an open-source platform is that we believe the most efficient way for the modality to develop is by freely sharing information and lowering the threshold for new investigators to enter the field by sharing imager designs. We have benefited from the support of other groups and hope this will aide other new (or established) labs. In the spirit of the project we encourage groups to reach out to the primary authors of this site with contributions, critiques, and any questions.

The projects which are listed (so far) are accesible either [on the project page](/projects/) or at the primary repository locations [here](https://Github.com/OS-MPI).

### License Information
We employ two licenses for this project, one that covers software and another for hardware. 
* Software is published under the GNU General Public License v3.0, a strong copyleft license that permits the use for personal and commercial ventures yet restricts said uses in that if they are redistributed, they must also be open-source with the same license. Please read the license [here](https://github.com/OS-MPI/Small_Bore_Imager/blob/master/LICENSE) or reach out to any of the authors if you have questions.  
* Hardware is similarly licensed with the [CERN Open Hardware License v1.2](https://ohwr.org/project/cernohl/wikis/Documents/CERN-OHL-version-1.2). The permissions and restrictions are similar but written with hardware licensure as the focus. 

These were chosen as they are very free with respect to academic and intellectual liberties they permit while limiting the use of our developed software and designs for projects which do not align with the goals of this initiative.
