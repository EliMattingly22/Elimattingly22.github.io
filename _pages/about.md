Hello and welcome to the site! My name is Eli, and this is where I'll be documenting the projects I am working on. These will typically either fall under the realm of electrical or mechanical engineering, or art and perhaps a something else if it comes up. I am working towards my Ph.D. in the Health Sciences and Technology program at MIT, so perhaps there will be some discussion on my experiences going thorugh this. Who knows. 

The primary reason that I want to create this site is that a major component of my education wasn't through traditional lectures, but rather it was through the collective knowledge base that has accumulated on the internet, and hopefully, by publishing my designs and thoughts here I can, in some small way, contribute to that collective.
